## Block Shuffle

#### Motivaton
I was messing around with some machine-learning packages a few months ago and once again encountered the mountains of literature on image based machine learning techniques. This made me realize that I have very little knowledge of image manipulation techniques or concepts. Its possible that learning a bit about how images work would give me enough insight to be able to translate some of the concepts from that literature into the financial world.

I am also somewhat into quilting and think it would be cool to use some algorithm to design a quilt for me. It would be cool to have a function which could take as input a target design and a set of building blocks, and output a design plan.

Fow now I am just creating an image from components of another, which as it turns out is just an optimization problem.
